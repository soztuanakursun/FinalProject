## The changes that have been made
Some design and file changes were made during the project.There are many reasons for this: errors in the firebase process and design errors but despite these reasons, the application works.

* Instead of removing GroupInformation.java, codes that are suitable for the design have been added.
* GroupAddMember.java file has been extracted. It was ensured that people from outside are not added to the group.(Firebase Error)
* The BrowseProject.java file has been disabled because it has been modified to suit the design.
* Design changes were made in some files. This is because the app works smoother and looks beautiful.
